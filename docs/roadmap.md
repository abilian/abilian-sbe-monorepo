#### Focus Areas:

1. **Documentation Enhancements**:

   - [ ] Improve and expand documentation for both developers and end-users.
   - [ ] Review and update existing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to reflect the latest system architecture and practices.

1. **UI Modernization**:

   - [ ] Transition to modern UI frameworks: [Flask-Vite](https://github.com/abilian/flask-vite), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), and [htmx](https://htmx.org/).
   - [ ] Streamline the front-end development process (see: ADR 006).

1. **Codebase Refinement**:

   - [x] Enhance type annotations and adopt modern Python coding practices, such as replacing legacy formatting with f-strings.
   - [ ] Refactor the application class for simplicity and modularity.
   - [ ] Split the extensions module to improve maintainability and logical separation.

1. **Dependency Updates**:

   - [x] Upgrade critical dependencies like SQLAlchemy to their latest stable versions.
   - [x] Address vulnerabilities by removing deprecated or insecure dependencies, such as `sqlparse`.

1. **Pipeline and CI/CD Enhancements**:

   - [x] Support for additional Python versions (e.g., Python 3.12), ensuring long-term compatibility.
   - [ ] Reactivate Alpine builds and optimize CI pipelines for better efficiency.

1. **Open Source Compliance**:

   - [x] Ensure REUSE compliance across the project.
   - [x] Add copyright notices and improve licensing transparency.

1. **SlapOS Integration**

   - [ ] Update POC to MVP


### Version 1.3 (Q1 or Q2 2025)

#### Focus Areas:

1. **Modular Architecture**:

   - [ ] Develop and implement a plugin system to allow customizable integrations.
   - [ ] Introduce pluggable components for storage (e.g., S3, MinIO) and search (e.g., Typesense, Elasticsearch) (see: ADR 005).

1. **Enhanced Security**:

   - [ ] Overhaul authentication and permission systems with OpenID Connect (OIDC), SCIM, and RBAC (see: ADR 001, ADR 002, ADR 003).

1. **UI and UX Improvements**:

   - [ ] Finalize the adoption of modern UI technologies to enhance usability and responsiveness.

1. **Community Engagement**:

   - [ ] Foster an active contributor base through detailed onboarding guides, workshops, and governance transparency.

1. **Release Planning**:

   - [ ] Prepare a streamlined process for ongoing feature releases and updates.

#### Tasks

- [ ] Plugin architecture.
  - [ ] Pluggable search indexes (e.g. Typesense, ElasticSearch, etc.)
  - [ ] Pluggable file storage (e.g. S3, MinIO, etc.)
    - See: [ADR 005](../notes/adrs/005-storage.md)
- [ ] Overhaul of the authentication and permissions system.
  - See: [ADR 001](../notes/adrs/001-oidc.md), [ADR 002](../notes/adrs/002-scim.md), [ADR 003](../notes/adrs/003-rbac.md), [ADR 004](../notes/adrs/004-permissions.md).
