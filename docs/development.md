# Abilian SBE Development Guide

## Setting Up a Development Environment

- TODO

## Testing and QA

### Running Tests

Once the development environment is set up, you can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
make test
```

You can additionally run several linters and checkers, using the following command:

```bash
make
```

Using `nox` is another option, to run tests and linters in clean and isolated environments:

```bash
nox
```

### Continuous Integration Builds

Abilian SBE uses SourceHut for continuous integration. The CI configuration is in the `.builds` directory.
