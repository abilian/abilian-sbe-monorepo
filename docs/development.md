# Abilian SBE Development Guide

## Setting Up a Development Environment

- TODO

## Running Tests

Once the development environment is set up, you can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
make test
```

You can additionally run several linters and checkers, using the following command:

```bash
make
```

Using `nox` is another option, to run tests and linters in clean and isolated environments:

```bash
nox
```
