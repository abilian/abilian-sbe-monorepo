"""Static resources served directly, outside the Vite build.

The flask-assets / LESS / Closure bundling pipeline this module used to own has
been replaced by Vite. What remains is the URL that serves `web/resources/`:
the vendored libraries `abilian_base.html` still loads with plain <script> tags
(jQuery, bootbox, FileAPI, datepicker, timepicker, typeahead) and the favicons.
