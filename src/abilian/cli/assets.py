"""Deprecated `flask assets` commands, kept so existing deployments keep booting.

The flask-assets/LESS/Closure pipeline is gone; assets are built by Vite
(`make front`) and ship inside the wheel. But `flask assets build` is baked into
deployment recipes we cannot retroactively edit -- notably the SlapOS instance
template, where it runs as a *supervised service*, so a failing command becomes
a restart loop rather than a one-off error.

flask-assets is still installed as a transitive dependency and registers its own
`assets` group, which now raises AttributeError because nothing initialises its
environment. These commands shadow it with a no-op that says what to run instead.

Remove once no deployment invokes `flask assets` any more.
