# End-to-end tests

Browser tests for the things the pytest suite structurally cannot see.

A page whose scripts never loaded, whose widgets never initialised, or whose
icon font is missing still returns a perfectly good 200. That is how the
Tailwind branch came to ship with no icons, no DataTables and a dead documents
module while `pytest` stayed green.

## Running

```bash
make test-e2e
# or:
cd e2e_playwright && honcho start
```

`honcho` starts three processes and exits with pytest's status when the suite
finishes, tearing the others down:

| process | what it does |
|---|---|
| `redis` | throwaway instance on port 6399, persistence off, so your own redis and its data are untouched |
| `web`   | `serve.sh`: recreates a SQLite database under `$E2E_DIR`, creates an admin user, serves on 8899 |
| `tests` | `run_tests.sh`: waits for the server, then runs pytest |

`pytest-playwright` is **not** a project dependency. `uv run --with` layers it
on and `playwright install` fetches the browser; both are cached after the first
run.

Overridable: `E2E_DIR`, `E2E_PORT`, `E2E_REDIS_PORT`, `E2E_EMAIL`,
`E2E_PASSWORD`, `BROWSER`, `BASE_URL`.

## Why it runs with debug off

Debug mode would point `vite_asset` at a Vite dev server that isn't running, so
the suite would test the wrong asset path — the production one is what ships and
what broke. Debug off also turns on Talisman, so the suite exercises the real
CSP and security headers.

`FLASK_TALISMAN_FORCE_HTTPS=false` keeps it on plain HTTP. Under TLS the
werkzeug dev server drops enough concurrent asset requests (fonts, avatars) to
make the suite flaky; the CSP and the other headers still apply.

## What it caught

On its first run, against the production configuration:

- **CSP blocked every inline script.** Talisman's default `default-src 'self'`
  policy, which nothing overrode, blocked the AMD shim, `abilian_init.js` and
  the deferred JS, so no legacy JavaScript ran at all. Pre-existing on `devel`.
- **The AMD shim ignored `define(name, factory)`**, the CommonJS-wrapper form
  `hogan-2.0.0.js` uses. Hogan stayed an empty object, `widgets/file.js` threw
  on `Hogan.compile`, and `widgets/image.js` lost its base class with it.
- **`/admin/dashboard` returned 500**: pandas removed the `"M"` offset alias in
  2.2, and the dashboard still used it.
