"""Smoke tests for the main pages.

The rest of the suite exercises models, services and views in isolation, so it
stays green even when the rendered page is unusable. These tests render the
pages a user actually visits and check that the layout came out whole, which is
the safety net the Bootstrap -> Tailwind migration needs.
